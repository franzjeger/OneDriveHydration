# OneDriveHydration

A native OneDrive client for Linux built on HydrationAPI's fail-closed filesystem and
cloud-access invariants.

This repository is intentionally a new product shell rather than a continuation of the
FUSE sync engine in [OneDriveForLinux](https://github.com/franzjeger/OneDriveForLinux).
OneDriveForLinux remains the working reference client and a donor for product features;
HydrationAPI owns hydration, reconciliation, uploads, Graph delta state and the privileged
security boundary.

## Status

Early integration work. The daemon has device-code enrollment, automatic primary-drive
discovery, reviewed GraphAccess wiring and constant-memory streamed downloads. Desktop
integration, resumable ranges and packaging are not yet complete. It is not ready for user data.

## Design rules

- The privileged helper never receives credentials and never opens network connections.
- Missing or inconsistent state fails closed; cursors never advance past unapplied changes.
- HydrationAPI is the only owner of delta, upload and reconciliation state.
- Code ported from OneDriveForLinux must be isolated behind the new interfaces and retain
  its original license and attribution.
- No live credential is required by unit or integration tests.

## Current development invocation

Enroll once; the refresh token is stored in a private state directory:

```text
cargo run -p onedrive-hydration-daemon -- auth \
  --state-dir "$HOME/.local/state/onedrive-hydration" \
  --client-id <azure-client-id>
```

Then start the daemon. The signed-in user's primary drive ID is resolved automatically:

```text
cargo run -p onedrive-hydration-daemon -- run \
  --mount "$HOME/OneDrive" \
  --state-dir "$HOME/.local/state/onedrive-hydration" \
  --client-id <azure-client-id>
```
